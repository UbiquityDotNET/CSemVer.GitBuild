  This projects serves as a convenient placeholder to reference the doc files. It uses project relative include
  and exclude patterns to simplify referencing ALL files but skipping over the generated API files.
  (Getting docfx to generate files into a folder outside of the build tree (IntermediateOutputPath) but then
  reference content from that is an exercise in frustration - problem unsolved. So this is used instead.)
