    /// <para>Cloning this for the tests, means they are independent of the versioning library,
    /// which makes it a candidate for isolation in a different repo/build that depends on the
    /// TASK package for generation of versions</para>

    /// Using just the commit ID, or even the GIT height, for a GIT repo, does NOT differentiate
    /// one local build from the next. Use of the time stamp for all does. Normally, the automated
    /// builds will use the time stamp of the head commit for this so that they remain consistent
    /// no matter how many times the automated build is re-run. Locally, the values are generated/set
