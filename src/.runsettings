This file provides overrides/settings for ALL tests in the solution IN THIS DIRECTORY!
.runsettings file auto detection is VERY finicky. It must be named '.runsettings' [Exactly]
AND it must exist as a sibling of the solution file in the FS hierarchy.

Most importantly, it overrides the test output directory location to use a proper build
output location. (Source tree is NOT polluted by test results!).

NOTE: Successful test runs will cleanup the subdirectory, but failed runs leave it behind!
