        While some aspects of this analyzer are helpful, it hasn't been without issues. Worse, the last non-preview release
        was Apr of 2019, That's a LONG time ago. Even the most recent preview (beta) was back in Dec. of 2023. So not much
        sign of life/activity nor hope of updates to bug fixes. It's sad to see this go as relying on a developer/reviewers
        to follow the rules is a recipe for failures. Automation is how that works. (With occasional overrides that should
        get the attention of a reviewer).
